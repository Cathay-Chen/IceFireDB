# IceFireDB-SQLProxy

IceFireDB-SQLProxy helps decentralize traditional SQL database data. Provide a convenient mechanism to build a globally distributed storage system with automatic networking. Commands are automatically synchronized between the SQL agents in the network, and the IceFireDB SQL agent writes data to MySQL storage.

Through the decentralized middleware network proxy, decentralized data synchronization can be enabled for MySQL databases commonly used in web2 applications.
